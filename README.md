# Conda Python Intro

I had two weeks to introduce Python to several communications grad students who might not ever do any data science work, but they bravely wanted to learn some Python.

So first, we did a small install with **Miniconda** and **Jupyter Notebook**:

[Install Python 3.x, Miniconda, and Jupyter Notebook](http://bit.ly/mm-conda)

I got them started with a blank Notebook in one 50-minute class period.

Two days later they saw this [slide deck](http://bit.ly/python-intro2-slides), played briefly in the interpreter, and ran [a little script](https://github.com/macloo/python-beginners/blob/master/week01/a_tiny_script.py) from a file. Then they got a Jupyter Notebook with 12 beginner problems to solve (some are just making variables and using math operators) &mdash; that Notebook is *not* online.

Then I got ambitious.

I wanted them to have an experience of scraping with **BeautifulSoup** *and also* an experience using **Pandas**, so I made two Notebooks and we're going to walk through them. You'll find them in this repo.
